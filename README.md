### Style Guides
- [Copywriting Style Guide](./copywriting-style-guide.md)

## What a pity
Our core purpose and mission of the standards above is quite simple, helps members of Teambition F2E Group to build consistent good habits. There is a bad news that the current documentations are only available in Chinese, I wish we could translate into Enligsh or write directly in English.
